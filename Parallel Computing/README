This was one of the two most challenging courses I took in school. It was a graduate level course, and I could have used a stronger math background. I wish I wasn't taking such a heavy load so that I could have focused more on it--I think this will also be some of the most important knowledge going forward.

We mostly focused on architecture and analysis, and implemented our algorithms using MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA.
